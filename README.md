# TANZANIAN TOURISM

The Tanzanian tourism sector plays a significant role in the Tanzanian economy, contributing 17% to the country's GDP and 25% of all foreign exchange revenues. The sector, which provides direct employment for more than 600,000 people and up to 2 million people indirectly, generted approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 according to government statistics. Tanzania received a record 1.1 million international visitor arrivals in 2014, mostly from Europe, the US and Africa. Tanzania is the only country in the world which has allocated more than 25% of it's total area of wildlife, national parks and protected areas. There are 16 national parks in Tanzania, 28 game reserves, 44 game-controlled areas, two marine parks and one conservation area.


I will explore and build a linear regression model that will predict the spending behaviour of tourists visiting Tanzania. The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.
